        Use the `/bank_transfer/balance/get` endpoint to see the available
        balance in your bank transfer account. Debit transfers increase this
        balance once their status is posted. Credit transfers decrease this
        balance when they are created.


        The transactable balance shows the amount in your account that you are
        able to use for transfers, and is essentially your available balance
        minus your minimum balance.


        Note that this endpoint can only be used with FBO accounts, when using
        Bank Transfers in the Full Service configuration. It cannot be used on
        your own account when using Bank Transfers in the BTS Platform
        configuration.

        As an alternative to adding Items via Link, you can also use the
        `/bank_transfer/migrate_account` endpoint to migrate known account and
        routing numbers to Plaid Items.  Note that Items created in this way are
        not compatible with endpoints for other products, such as
        `/accounts/balance/get`, and can only be used with Bank Transfer
        endpoints.  If you require access to other endpoints, create the Item
        through Link instead.  Access to `/bank_transfer/migrate_account` is not
        enabled by default; to obtain access, contact your Plaid Account
        Manager.
