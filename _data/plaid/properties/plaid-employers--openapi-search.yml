        `/employers/search` allows you the ability to search Plaidâ€™s database of
        known employers, for use with Deposit Switch. You can use this endpoint
        to look up a user's employer in order to confirm that they are
        supported. Users with non-supported employers can then be routed out of
        the Deposit Switch flow.


        The data in the employer database is currently limited. As the Deposit
        Switch and Income products progress through their respective beta
        periods, more employers are being regularly added. Because the employer
        database is frequently updated, we recommend that you do not cache or
        store data from this endpoint for more than a day.
