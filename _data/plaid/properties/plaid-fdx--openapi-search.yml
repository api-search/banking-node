    PlaidError:
      description: >-
        Errors are identified by `error_code` and categorized by `error_type`.
        Use these in preference to HTTP status codes to identify and handle
        specific errors. HTTP status codes are set and provide the broadest
        categorization of errors: 4xx codes are for developer- or user-related
        errors, and 5xx codes are for Plaid-related errors, and the status will
        be 2xx in non-error cases. An Item with a non-`null` error object will
        only be part of an API response when calling `/item/get` to view Item
        status. Otherwise, error fields will be `null` if no error has occurred;
        if an error has occurred, an error code will be returned instead.

            array of errors containing a breakdown of these errors on the
            individual Item level, if any can be identified.


            `causes` will only be provided for the `error_type`
            `ASSET_REPORT_ERROR`. `causes` will also not be populated inside an
            error nested within a `warning` object.
