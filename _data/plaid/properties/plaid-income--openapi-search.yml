        `/income/verification/create` begins the income verification process by
        returning an `income_verification_id`. You can then provide the
        `income_verification_id` to `/link/token/create` under the
        `income_verification` parameter in order to create a Link instance that
        will prompt the user to go through the income verification flow. Plaid
        will fire an `INCOME` webhook once the user completes the Payroll Income
        flow, or when the uploaded documents in the Document Income flow have
        finished processing.

        If Document Income was used, the documents will be those the user
        provided in Link. For Payroll Income, the most recent files available

        for download from the payroll provider will be available from this
        endpoint.


        The response to `/income/verification/documents/download` is a ZIP file
        in binary data. If a `document_id` is passed, a single document will be
        contained in this file.

        If not, the response will contain all documents associated with the
        verification.


        The `request_id` is returned in the `Plaid-Request-ID` header.

        `/income/verification/precheck` is an optional endpoint that can be
        called before initializing a Link session for income verification. It
        evaluates whether a given user is supportable by digital income
        verification and returns a `precheck_id` that can be provided to
        `/link/token/create`. If the user is eligible for digital verification,
        providing the `precheck_id` in this way will generate a Link UI
        optimized for the end user and their specific employer. If the user
        cannot be confirmed as eligible, the `precheck_id` can still be provided
        to `/link/token/create` and the user can still use the income
        verification flow, but they may be required to manually upload a paystub
        to verify their income.


        While all request fields are optional, providing either `employer` or
        `transactions_access_tokens` data will increase the chance of receiving
        a useful result.


        This endpoint has been deprecated; new integrations should use
        `/credit/payroll_income/precheck` instead.

        Errors are identified by `error_code` and categorized by `error_type`.
        Use these in preference to HTTP status codes to identify and handle
        specific errors. HTTP status codes are set and provide the broadest
        categorization of errors: 4xx codes are for developer- or user-related

        status. Otherwise, error fields will be `null` if no error has occurred;
