      description: >-
        The `/processor/liabilities/get` endpoint returns various details about
        a loan or credit account. Liabilities data is available primarily for US
        financial institutions, with some limited coverage of Canadian
        institutions. Currently supported account types are account type
        `credit` with account subtype `credit card` or `paypal`, and account
        type `loan` with account subtype `student` or `mortgage`.


        The types of information returned by Liabilities can include balances
        and due dates, loan terms, and account details such as original loan
        amount and guarantor. Data is refreshed approximately once per day; the
        latest data can be retrieved by calling `/processor/liabilities/get`.


        Note: This request may take some time to complete if `liabilities` was
        not specified as an initial product when creating the processor token.
        This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to
        retrieve the additional data.

        The `/liabilities/get` endpoint returns various details about an Item
        with loan or credit accounts. Liabilities data is available primarily
        for US financial institutions, with some limited coverage of Canadian
        institutions. Currently supported account types are account type
        `credit` with account subtype `credit card` or `paypal`, and account
        type `loan` with account subtype `student` or `mortgage`. To limit
        accounts listed in Link to types and subtypes supported by Liabilities,
        you can use the `account_filters` parameter when [creating a Link
        token](https://plaid.com/docs/api/tokens/#linktokencreate).


        The types of information returned by Liabilities can include balances
        and due dates, loan terms, and account details such as original loan
        amount and guarantor. Data is refreshed approximately once per day; the
        latest data can be retrieved by calling `/liabilities/get`.


        Note: This request may take some time to complete if `liabilities` was
        not specified as an initial product when creating the Item. This is
        because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to retrieve
        the additional data.
