        Create a payment recipient for payment initiation.  The recipient must
        be in Europe, within a country that is a member of the Single Euro
        Payment Area (SEPA) or a non-Eurozone country
        [supported](https://plaid.com/global) by Plaid. For a standing order
        (recurring) payment, the recipient must be in the UK.


        It is recommended to use `bacs` in the UK and `iban` in EU.


        The endpoint is idempotent: if a developer has already made a request
        with the same payment details, Plaid will return the same
        `recipient_id`.

        Reverse a settled payment from a Plaid virtual account.


        The original payment must be in a settled state to be refunded.

        To refund partially, specify the amount as part of the request.

        If the amount is not specified, the refund amount will be equal to all

        of the remaining payment amount that has not been refunded yet.


        The refund will go back to the source account that initiated the
        payment.

        The original payment must have been initiated to a Plaid virtual account

        so that this account can be used to initiate the refund.


        Providing counterparty information such as date of birth and address
        increases 

        the likelihood of refund being successful without human intervention.

        After creating a payment recipient, you can use the
        `/payment_initiation/payment/create` endpoint to create a payment to
        that recipient.  Payments can be one-time or standing order (recurring)
        and can be denominated in either EUR, GBP or other chosen
        [currency](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/payment-initiation/#payment_initiation-payment-create-request-amount-currency). 
        If making domestic GBP-denominated payments, your recipient must have
        been created with BACS numbers. In general, EUR-denominated payments
        will be sent via SEPA Credit Transfer, GBP-denominated payments will be
        sent via the Faster Payments network and for non-Eurozone markets
        typically via the local payment scheme, but the payment network used
        will be determined by the institution. Payments sent via Faster Payments
        will typically arrive immediately, while payments sent via SEPA Credit
        Transfer or other local payment schemes will typically arrive in one
        business day.


        Standing orders (recurring payments) must be denominated in GBP and can
        only be sent to recipients in the UK. Once created, standing order
        payments cannot be modified or canceled via the API. An end user can
        cancel or modify a standing order directly on their banking application
        or website, or by contacting the bank. Standing orders will follow the
        payment rules of the underlying rails (Faster Payments in UK). Payments
        can be sent Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays. If the
        pre-arranged date falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the payment is
        made on the next working day. It is not possible to guarantee the exact
        time the payment will reach the recipient’s account, although at least
        90% of standing order payments are sent by 6am.


        In the Development environment, payments must be below 5 GBP or other
        chosen
        [currency](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/payment-initiation/#payment_initiation-payment-create-request-amount-currency).
        For details on any payment limits in Production, contact your Plaid
        Account Manager.

        The `/payment_initiation/payment/token/create` endpoint has been
        deprecated. New Plaid customers will be unable to use this endpoint, and
        existing customers are encouraged to migrate to the newer,
        `link_token`-based flow. The recommended flow is to provide the
        `payment_id` to `/link/token/create`, which returns a `link_token` used
        to initialize Link.


        The `/payment_initiation/payment/token/create` is used to create a
        `payment_token`, which can then be used in Link initialization to enter
        a payment initiation flow. You can only use a `payment_token` once. If
        this attempt fails, the end user aborts the flow, or the token expires,
        you will need to create a new payment token. Creating a new payment
        token does not require end user input.

        The `/payment_initiation/payment/get` endpoint can be used to check the
        status of a payment, as well as to receive basic information such as
        recipient and payment amount. In the case of standing orders, the
        `/payment_initiation/payment/get` endpoint will provide information
        about the status of the overall standing order itself; the API cannot be
        used to retrieve payment status for individual payments within a
        standing order.
