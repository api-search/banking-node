        `/sandbox/payment_profile/reset_login/` forces a Payment Profile into a
        state where the login is no longer valid. This makes it easy to test
        update mode for Payment Profile in the Sandbox environment.

         After calling `/sandbox/payment_profile/reset_login`, calls to the `/transfer/authorization/create` with the Payment Profile will result in a `decision_rationale` `PAYMENT_PROFILE_LOGIN_REQUIRED`. You can then use update mode for Payment Profile to restore it into a good state.

         In order to invoke this endpoint, you must first [create a Payment Profile](https://plaid.com/docs/transfer/add-to-app/#create-a-payment-profile-optional) and [go through the Link flow](https://plaid.com/docs/transfer/add-to-app/#create-a-link-token).

        Use `/payment_profile/create` endpoint to create a new payment profile.

        To initiate the account linking experience, call `/link/token/create`
        and provide the `payment_profile_token` in the
        `transfer.payment_profile_token` field.

        You can then use the `payment_profile_token` when creating transfers
        using `/transfer/authorization/create` and `/transfer/create`.

        Errors are identified by `error_code` and categorized by `error_type`.
        Use these in preference to HTTP status codes to identify and handle
        specific errors. HTTP status codes are set and provide the broadest
        categorization of errors: 4xx codes are for developer- or user-related
        errors, and 5xx codes are for Plaid-related errors, and the status will
        be 2xx in non-error cases. An Item with a non-`null` error object will
        only be part of an API response when calling `/item/get` to view Item
        status. Otherwise, error fields will be `null` if no error has occurred;
        if an error has occurred, an error code will be returned instead.
