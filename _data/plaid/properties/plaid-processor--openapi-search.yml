        The `/processor/auth/get` endpoint returns the bank account and bank
        identification number (such as the routing number, for US accounts), for
        a checking or savings account that''s associated with a given
        `processor_token`. The endpoint also returns high-level account data and
        balances when available.


        Versioning note: API versions 2019-05-29 and earlier use a different
        schema for the `numbers` object returned by this endpoint. For details,

        This endpoint returns the account associated with a given processor
        token.


        This endpoint retrieves cached information, rather than extracting fresh
        information from the institution. As a result, the account balance
        returned may not be up-to-date; for realtime balance information, use
        `/processor/balance/get` instead. Note that some information is
        nullable.

        The `/processor/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to receive
        user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some
        loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage
        may be limited). Transaction data is standardized across financial
        institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name,
        entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is
        standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other
        meta information where available.


        Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the
        sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift. 
        Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the
        institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in
        `/processor/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and
        posted
        transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).


        Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with a
        processor token, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and
        `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions`
        response body field to fetch all available transactions.


        Data returned by `/processor/transactions/get` will be the data
        available for the processor token as of the most recent successful check
        for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times
        a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day,
        depending on the institution. To force Plaid to check for new
        transactions, you can use the `/processor/transactions/refresh`
        endpoint.


        Note that data may not be immediately available to
        `/processor/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions
        data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or
        upon the first call to `/processor/transactions/get`, if it wasn't. If
        no transaction history is ready when `/processor/transactions/get` is
        called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.


        To receive Transactions webhooks for a processor token, set its webhook
        URL via the
        [`/processor/token/webhook/update`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortokenwebhookupdate)
        endpoint.

        This endpoint replaces `/processor/transactions/get` and its associated
        webhooks for most common use-cases.


        The `/processor/transactions/sync` endpoint allows developers to
        subscribe to all transactions associated with a processor token and get
        updates synchronously in a stream-like manner, using a cursor to track
        which updates have already been seen. `/processor/transactions/sync`
        provides the same functionality as `/processor/transactions/get` and can
        be used instead of `/processor/transactions/get` to simplify the process
        of tracking transactions updates.


        This endpoint provides user-authorized transaction data for `credit`,
        `depository`, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account
        subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history
        from `investments` accounts, use `/investments/transactions/get`
        instead.


        Returned transactions data is grouped into three types of update,
        indicating whether the transaction was added, removed, or modified since
        the last call to the API.


        In the first call to `/processor/transactions/sync` for a processor
        token, the endpoint will return all historical transactions data
        associated with that processor token up until the time of the API call
        (as "adds"), which then generates a `next_cursor` for that processor
        token. In subsequent calls, send the `next_cursor` to receive only the
        changes that have occurred since the previous call.


        Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with a
        processor token, results are paginated. The `has_more` field specifies
        if additional calls are necessary to fetch all available transaction
        updates. Call `/processor/transactions/sync` with the new cursor,
        pulling all updates, until `has_more` is `false`.


        When retrieving paginated updates, track both the `next_cursor` from the
        latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which
        `has_more` was `true`; if a call to `/processor/transactions/sync` fails
        when retrieving a paginated update, which can occur as a result of the
        [`TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION`](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/transactions/#transactions_sync_mutation_during_pagination)
        error, the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning
        with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying
        only the single request that failed.


        Whenever new or updated transaction data becomes available,
        `/processor/transactions/sync` will provide these updates. Plaid
        typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may
        occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution.
        To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the
        `/processor/transactions/refresh` endpoint.


        Note that for newly created processor tokens, data may not be
        immediately available to `/processor/transactions/sync`. Plaid begins
        preparing transactions data when the corresponding Item is created, but
        the process can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to
        complete, depending on the number of transactions available.


        To receive Transactions webhooks for a processor token, set its webhook
        URL via the
        [`/processor/token/webhook/update`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortokenwebhookupdate)
        endpoint.

        `/processor/transactions/refresh` is an optional endpoint for users of
        the Transactions product. It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch
        the newest transactions for a processor token. This on-demand extraction
        takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically
        occur one or more times per day for any Transactions-enabled processor
        token. If changes to transactions are discovered after calling
        `/processor/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: for
        `/transactions/sync` users,
        [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available)
        will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed.
        For users of both `/processor/transactions/sync` and
        `/processor/transactions/get`,
        [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed)
        will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and
        [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update)
        will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can
        be fetched by calling `/processor/transactions/get` or
        `/processor/transactions/sync`. Note that the
        `/processor/transactions/refresh` endpoint is not supported for Capital
        One (`ins_128026`) and will result in a `PRODUCTS_NOT_SUPPORTED` error
        if called on a processor token from that institution.


        As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency
        may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10
        seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter
        errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when
        making requests.


        `/processor/transactions/refresh` is offered as an add-on to
        Transactions and has a separate [fee
        model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee). To request access
        to this endpoint, submit a [product access
        request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your
        Plaid account manager.

        The `/processor/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint allows developers
        to receive a summary of the recurring outflow and inflow streams
        (expenses and deposits) from a user’s checking, savings or credit card
        accounts. Additionally, Plaid provides key insights about each recurring
        stream including the category, merchant, last amount, and more.
        Developers can use these insights to build tools and experiences that
        help their users better manage cash flow, monitor subscriptions, reduce
        spend, and stay on track with bill payments.


        This endpoint is offered as an add-on to Transactions. To request access
        to this endpoint, submit a [product access
        request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your
        Plaid account manager.


        This endpoint can only be called on a processor token that has already
        been initialized with Transactions (either during Link, by specifying it
        in `/link/token/create`; or after Link, by calling
        `/processor/transactions/get` or `/processor/transactions/sync`). Once
        all historical transactions have been fetched, call
        `/processor/transactions/recurring/get` to receive the Recurring
        Transactions streams and subscribe to the
        [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update)
        webhook. To know when historical transactions have been fetched, if you
        are using `/processor/transactions/sync` listen for the
        [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#SyncUpdatesAvailableWebhook-historical-update-complete)
        webhook and check that the `historical_update_complete` field in the
        payload is `true`. If using `/processor/transactions/get`, listen for
        the
        [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update)
        webhook.


        After the initial call, you can call
        `/processor/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint at any point in the
        future to retrieve the latest summary of recurring streams. Listen to
        the
        [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update)
        webhook to be notified when new updates are available.


        To receive Transactions webhooks for a processor token, set its webhook
        URL via the
        [`/processor/token/webhook/update`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortokenwebhookupdate)
        endpoint.

        Use `/processor/signal/evaluate` to evaluate a planned ACH transaction
        as a processor to get a return risk assessment (such as a risk score and
        risk tier) and additional risk signals.


        In order to obtain a valid score for an ACH transaction, Plaid must have
        an access token for the account, and the Item must be healthy (receiving
        product updates) or have recently been in a healthy state. If the
        transaction does not meet eligibility requirements, an error will be
        returned corresponding to the underlying cause. If
        `/processor/signal/evaluate` is called on the same transaction multiple
        times within a 24-hour period, cached results may be returned. For more
        information please refer to our error documentation on [item
        errors](/docs/errors/item/) and [Link in Update
        Mode](/docs/link/update-mode/).


        Note: This request may take some time to complete if Signal is being
        added to an existing Item. This is because Plaid must communicate
        directly with the institution when retrieving the data for the first
        time. To reduce this latency, you can call `/signal/prepare` on the Item
        before you need to request Signal data.

        If you are using the [Plaid Transfer
        product](https://www.plaid.com/docs/transfer) to create transfers, it is
        not necessary to use this endpoint, as Plaid already knows whether the
        transfer was initiated.

        Call the `/processor/signal/return/report` endpoint to report a returned
        transaction that was previously sent to the `/processor/signal/evaluate`
        endpoint. Your feedback will be used by the model to incorporate the
        latest risk trend in your portfolio.


        If you are using the [Plaid Transfer
        product](https://www.plaid.com/docs/transfer) to create transfers, it is
        not necessary to use this endpoint, as Plaid already knows whether the
        transfer was returned.

        When a processor token is not initialized with Signal, call
        `/processor/signal/prepare` to opt-in that processor token to the Signal
        data collection process, which will improve the accuracy of the Signal

        If this endpoint is called with a processor token that is already
        initialized with Signal, it will return a 200 response and will not
        modify the processor token.

        The `/processor/liabilities/get` endpoint returns various details about
        a loan or credit account. Liabilities data is available primarily for US
        financial institutions, with some limited coverage of Canadian
        institutions. Currently supported account types are account type
        `credit` with account subtype `credit card` or `paypal`, and account
        type `loan` with account subtype `student` or `mortgage`.


        The types of information returned by Liabilities can include balances
        and due dates, loan terms, and account details such as original loan
        amount and guarantor. Data is refreshed approximately once per day; the
        latest data can be retrieved by calling `/processor/liabilities/get`.


        Note: This request may take some time to complete if `liabilities` was
        not specified as an initial product when creating the processor token.
        This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to
        retrieve the additional data.

        The `/processor/identity/match` endpoint generates a match score, which
        indicates how well the provided identity data matches the identity
        information on file with the account holder's financial institution.


        Fields within the `balances` object will always be null when retrieved
        by `/identity/match`. Instead, use the free `/accounts/get` endpoint to
        request balance cached data, or `/accounts/balance/get` for real-time
        data.


        This request may take some time to complete if Identity was not
        specified as an initial product when creating the Item. This is because
        Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to retrieve the
        data.

          The `/processor/balance/get` endpoint returns the real-time balance
          for the account associated with a given `processor_token`.


          The current balance is the total amount of funds in the account. The
          available balance is the current balance less any outstanding holds or
          debits that have not yet posted to the account.


          Note that not all institutions calculate the available balance. In the
          event that available balance is unavailable from the institution,
          Plaid will return an available balance value of `null`.

        Used to create a token suitable for sending to Stripe to enable

        see [Add Stripe to your
        app](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/partnerships/stripe/).


        Note that the Stripe bank account token is a one-time use token. To
        store bank account information for later use, you can use a Stripe
        customer object and create an associated bank account from the token, or
        you can use a Stripe Custom account and create an associated external
        bank account from the token. This bank account information should work
        indefinitely, unless the user's bank account information changes or they
        revoke Plaid's permissions to access their account. Stripe bank account
        information cannot be modified once the bank account token has been
        created. If you ever need to change the bank account details used by
        Stripe for a specific customer, have the user go through Link again and
        create a new bank account token from the new `access_token`.


        Bank account tokens can also be revoked, using `/item/remove`.
