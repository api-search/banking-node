        Use `/processor/signal/evaluate` to evaluate a planned ACH transaction
        as a processor to get a return risk assessment (such as a risk score and
        risk tier) and additional risk signals.


        In order to obtain a valid score for an ACH transaction, Plaid must have
        an access token for the account, and the Item must be healthy (receiving
        product updates) or have recently been in a healthy state. If the
        transaction does not meet eligibility requirements, an error will be
        returned corresponding to the underlying cause. If
        `/processor/signal/evaluate` is called on the same transaction multiple
        times within a 24-hour period, cached results may be returned. For more
        information please refer to our error documentation on [item
        errors](/docs/errors/item/) and [Link in Update
        Mode](/docs/link/update-mode/).


        Note: This request may take some time to complete if Signal is being
        added to an existing Item. This is because Plaid must communicate
        directly with the institution when retrieving the data for the first
        time. To reduce this latency, you can call `/signal/prepare` on the Item
        before you need to request Signal data.

            In the Assets product, a request can pertain to more than one Item.
            If an error is returned for such a request, `causes` will return an
            array of errors containing a breakdown of these errors on the
            individual Item level, if any can be identified.


            `causes` will only be provided for the `error_type`
            `ASSET_REPORT_ERROR`. `causes` will also not be populated inside an
            error nested within a `warning` object.
