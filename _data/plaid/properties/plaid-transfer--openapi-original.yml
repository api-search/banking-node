        Use the `/transfer/authorization/create` endpoint to authorize a
        transfer. This endpoint must be called prior to calling
        `/transfer/create`.


        There are three possible outcomes to calling this endpoint: If the
        `authorization.decision` in the response is `declined`, the proposed
        transfer has failed the risk check and you cannot proceed with the
        transfer. If the `authorization.decision` is `approved`, and the
        `authorization.rationale_code` is `null`, the transfer has passed the
        risk check and you can proceed to call `/transfer/create`. If the
        `authorization.decision` is `approved` and the
        `authorization.rationale_code` is non-`null`, the risk check could not
        be run: you may proceed with the transfer, but should perform your own
        risk evaluation. For more details, see the response schema.


        In Plaid's Sandbox environment the decisions will be returned as
        follows:

          - To approve a transfer with `null` rationale code, make an authorization request with an `amount` less than the available balance in the account.

          - To approve a transfer with the rationale code `MANUALLY_VERIFIED_ITEM`, create an Item in Link through the [Same Day Micro-deposits flow](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/coverage/testing/#testing-same-day-micro-deposits).

          - To approve a transfer with the rationale code `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED`, [reset the login for an Item](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/#item_login_required).

          - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `NSF`, the available balance on the account must be less than the authorization `amount`. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.

          - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `RISK`, the available balance on the account must be exactly $0. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.

        As an alternative to adding Items via Link, you can also use the
        `/transfer/migrate_account` endpoint to migrate known account and
        routing numbers to Plaid Items. If you intend to create wire transfers
        on this account, you must provide `wire_routing_number`. Note that Items
        created in this way are not compatible with endpoints for other
        products, such as `/accounts/balance/get`, and can only be used with
        Transfer endpoints.  If you require access to other endpoints, create
        the Item through Link instead.  Access to `/transfer/migrate_account` is
        not enabled by default; to obtain access, contact your Plaid Account
        Manager.

        Use the `/transfer/refund/create` endpoint to create a refund for a
        transfer. A transfer can be refunded if the transfer was initiated in
        the past 180 days.


        Processing of the refund will not occur until at least 4 business days
        following the transfer's settlement date, plus any hold/settlement
        delays. This 3-day window helps better protect your business from
        regular ACH returns. Consumer initiated returns (unauthorized returns)
        could still happen for about 60 days from the settlement date. If the
        original transfer is canceled, returned or failed, all pending refunds
        will automatically be canceled. Processed refunds cannot be revoked.

        Use the `/sandbox/transfer/test_clock/create` endpoint to create a

        A test clock object represents an independent timeline and has a
        `virtual_time` field indicating the current timestamp of the timeline.
        Test clocks are used for testing recurring transfers in Sandbox.


        A test clock can be associated with up to 5 recurring transfers.

        Use the `/sandbox/transfer/test_clock/advance` endpoint to advance a
        `test_clock` in the Sandbox environment.


        A test clock object represents an independent timeline and has a
        `virtual_time` field indicating the current timestamp of the timeline. A
        test clock can be advanced by incrementing `virtual_time`, but may never
        go back to a lower `virtual_time`.


        If a test clock is advanced, we will simulate the changes that ought to
        occur during the time that elapsed.


        For example, a client creates a weekly recurring transfer with a test
        clock set at t. When the client advances the test clock by setting
        `virtual_time` = t + 15 days, 2 new originations should be created,
        along with the webhook events.


        The advancement of the test clock from its current `virtual_time` should
        be limited such that there are no more than 20 originations resulting
        from the advance operation on each `recurring_transfer` associated with
        the `test_clock`.


        For example, if the recurring transfer associated with this test clock
        originates once every 4 weeks, you can advance the `virtual_time` up to
        80 weeks on each API call.
